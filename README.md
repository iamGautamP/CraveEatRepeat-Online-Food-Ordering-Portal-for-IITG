# CraveEatRepeat : Online Food Delivery Portal
Project Overview:

Crave Eat Repeat is an online food ordering system designed to make it easy for users to order food from various shops, with a focus on college students and visitors. Below are the key components and steps involved in setting up this project.

1. Project Setup:

Installing Django and Creating a Virtual Environment: We start by setting up the project environment by installing Django, a web framework, and creating a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This ensures a clean and isolated development environment.

Database Setup: We set up a database to store essential information such as user details, food items, shop information, and more. This database will be used to manage and retrieve data throughout the application.

2. User Authentication and Authorization:

User Registration and Login: We implement user registration and login functionalities using Django's built-in authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely.

User Profiles: Each user can create a profile with additional information like their name and email. They can also update their profiles and change passwords as needed.

Multiple Login Types: We distinguish between users from within the college and those from outside, offering different login credentials. Additionally, shop owners have their unique login.

Authorization: There are two levels of authorization: database-level authorization and application-level authorization controlled by administrators.

3. Database Design:

Database Models: We create database models to represent food items, user information, and the review system. Orders placed will have attributes like order number, estimated delivery time, total amount, and user recommendations.

Django Admin: The Django Admin interface is used to manage shop details and user information. Administrators have the ability to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on food orders.

Recommendation System: We implement a recommendation system that suggests food items to users based on their own preferences and the preferences of others.

4. Search and Filtering:

Guide for New Users: We provide a guide for first-year students and guests visiting the college, listing the available shops.

Search Functionality: Users can search for food items based on various criteria such as offers and ratings.

Filtering: We offer filtering options to help users refine their search results based on their preferences.

5. Payment Gateway Integration:

Payment Gateway: We integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle secure online payments for food orders. Payments are confirmed before orders are placed. QR codes are used for payment, ensuring a secure and seamless transaction process.
6. Concurrency Handling:

Preventing Overordering: To prevent issues like overordering, we implement concurrency handling mechanisms using Django's built-in locking features and database transactions. This ensures data consistency and avoids order conflicts.
7. Frontend Development:

User-Friendly Design: We create a user-friendly and responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and possibly a frontend framework. Different templates are designed for various pages, such as the homepage, destination details, package details, user profiles, and more.
8. Testing and Optimization:

Thorough Testing: We conduct comprehensive testing to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

Performance Optimization: To enhance user experience, we optimize database queries, page load times, and overall system performance.

9. Security Measures:

Data Protection: We implement security best practices to protect user data and the system from potential vulnerabilities. Regular updates and security patches are applied to keep the system secure.
10. Transaction Management:

Order Placement: Transaction management is crucial during order placement to ensure the integrity of the data.

Payment Processing: We also focus on transaction management during payment processing to maintain data consistency and avoid errors.

By following these steps, Crave Eat Repeat aims to provide a safe, efficient, and user-friendly online food ordering experience, catering to the specific needs of college students and visitors.
